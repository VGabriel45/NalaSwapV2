This is a showcase project still in development, the purpose of this project is to show my skills as a Blockchain Developer and to learn more by building it from scratch.

NalaSwap is a Decentralized Exchange protocol on Binance Smart Chain which has many popular features:
  -  token swaps
  -  single token staking of the native NLA token which generates rewards for the stakers
  -  users can add liquidity for NLA token from NalaSwap which will create a liquidity pool on Pancakeswap
  -  users will get LP tokens after adding liquidity for NLA or any other ERC20 token that exists on Pancakeswap
  -  users can earn even more rewards by staking LP tokens into farms
  -  users can mint our Nft's from "The Eye" collection
  -  NFT's can be used to earn even more rewards in NLA tokens by staking them in our Nft Staking contract

The "NalaSwap" was inspired by my little cat "Nala", she's a 1.5 years old black cat, also the overall theme of the Dapp is "spooky" and the logo shows 
a cute black cat. 
P.S: The main focus for this project is around the smart contracts, testing and integration with the frontend, I will not put much effort into frontend 
design.
